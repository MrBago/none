\subsubsection{SH noise estimate}

The third method for estimating noise amplitudes evaluated in this study
is the same as the above method, except the spherical harmonic (SH)
functions are substituted for the tensor as the diffusion model. Even though the SH functions
are not a diffusion model, when truncated at a maximum SH order, they
can be used as a model for residual bootstrap purposes. Because the diffusion signal
is real valued and antipodally symmetric we can use the real valued spherical harmonic functions
defined in equation \ref{eqn:realSH}. The signal equation in terms of these SH functions is:

\begin{equation}
y(g_i) = \sum_{n=0}^{\inf} \sum_{m=-n}^l{c_{nm}Y_{nm}(g_i)}
\end{equation}

where $c_{nm}$ are the coefficients associated with each of the SH functions $Y_{nm}$ of degree $n$ and order $m$, and $g_i$ is a unit vector. It can often be useful to use a single index for the SH functions. We can replace the degree and order with a new single index $j$ and express the signal equation as:

\begin{equation}
y(g_i) = \sum_{j=1}^N{c_jY_j(g_i) + e_i}
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}
y = Xc + e
\end{equation}

where the matrix $X$ is defined $X_{ij} = Y_j(g_i)$ , and $c = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_N\}$ is a vector of coefficients. These
coefficients can be efficiently estimated using a least squares method
and take the form $c = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$.

The bootstrap samples are created using leverage-corrected and centered
residuals. The raw residuals can be computed as

\begin{equation}
e = y - Xc
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
e = y - X(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
e = y - Hy = (I - H)y
\end{equation}

where $H = X(X^TX)^(-1)X^T$ and $I$ is the identity matrix. The SH fitting is linear, so the
leverage correction term can be computed directly from $H$. The
leverage-corrected residuals are

\begin{equation}
r_i = \frac{e_i}{\sqrt{1 - h_i}}
\end{equation}

where $h_i = H_{ii}$ are the diagonal entries of the hat matrix. The leverage-corrected residual vector $r$ can also be written as

\begin{equation}
r = L(I - H)y
\end{equation}

where $L$ is a diagonal matrix such that $L_{ii} = 1 / \sqrt(1 - h_i)$. The centered residuals are defined as $q_i = r_i - \hat{r}$ or equivalently

\begin{equation}
q = C_NL(I - H)y
\end{equation}

where the centering matrix is defined as $C_N = 1 - \frac{1}{N}\vec{1}\vec{1}^T$. $q^*$ is created by sampling from $q$
with replacement and the bootstrap data sets is defined as

$S^* = Xc + q^*$

The noise amplitude of the diffusion signal can be estimated by taking
the variance of these bootstrap samples. We refer to the noise amplitude
estimated in this way as the SH noise estimate. In practice, we don't
need to generate bootstrap samples $S*$ if we notice that $E[var(S*)] = \frac{1}{N - 1}var(q)$. Also, the matrix $C_NL(I - H)$
can be computed a-priori, so the computation of the SH noise estimate in
each voxel is reduced to two operations, a matrix multiplication and the
computation of variance.

\subsubsection{Non-local means noise estimate}
The fourth method we evaluated for estimating noise maps was the
application of non-local means filter\cite{Coupe_2008}. This
de-noising filter has proven to be a valuable tool for improving data
quality of dMRI images before diffusion models are fit to the data or
fiber tracking is performed. By taking the difference between the noisy
data and the denoised data, we compute a set of residuals, which can be
used to generate a voxelwise noise map. Because non-local means
filtering requires the average noise amplitude as an input, it needs to
be used along with another noise estimation method. For this study, we
were only interested in the quality of the noise maps, so we used the
known noise amplitude measured from the ground truth data set as the
input. This procedure gives an upper bound, best possible result, for
the non-local means noise estimation method because in practice the
average noise must be computed from the data and may have some error. In
order to produce noise maps from the non-local means residuals, the
residuals must be scaled so that the average noise amplitude matches the
expected value. This step replaces the leverage correction step of the
other methods \cite{davison1997bootstrap}.
After scaling, the non-local means noise maps can be compared directly
to the ground truth noise maps.
