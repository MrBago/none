\section{Conclustion}

In this study we used whole brain tractography to model the relationship between WM DTI metrics and BMI. We found that both FA and MD reductions were associated with higher BMI, especially in the temporal aspects of the cingulate bundle and uncinate fasciculus. These associations were strongest when relative differences in MD and FA within each subject were accounted for. Three cortical regions in the temporal lob also showed thinning associated with higher BMI.
