\section{Conclusion}

We have demonstrated that model residual bootstrap methods can be used
to produce noise maps for HARDI data sets and are superior to the
currently used methods using b0 repetitions and nonlocal-means. For this
purpose, the DTI model only performs well if relatively low b-values are
used. The SH model performs well at all b-values, but the precision of
the SH noise estimate depends on the SH order used. In our simulations
and human diffusion data, SH orders 4 and 6 provided the best balance
between fitting the data well and preserving degrees of freedom for the
noise estimate.
