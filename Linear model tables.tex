    \caption{\label{tab:basic} This table shows the result of predicting BMI with each of the regressor independently using a linear regression. Gender, total GM and WM volumes as well as cortical and sub-cortical GM volumes were not correlated with BMI in our population. Age, FA, and MD showed a small, but statistically significant association with BMI.}
