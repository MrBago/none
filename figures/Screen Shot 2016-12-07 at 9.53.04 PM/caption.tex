\label{fig:tracking} A basic diagram of the FACT procedure. Each seed, in green, serves as the starting point for the streamline. The tracking direction is adjusted at each voxel boundary to follow the best estimate of the directional alignment of the local tissue. Tracking continues until a stopping condition is reached.
