\label{fig:dtiModle} The dti model posits that the diffusivity can be estimated as a tensor. The tensor can be represented as an ellipsoid in three dimensional space. The measured diffusivity, when gradient G is applied, depends on the orientation of the tensor relative to underlying tissues. When the gradient is aligned with the orientation of the tensor, the measured diffusivity is equal to the eigenvalues of the tensor, often called the axial and radial diffusivity.
