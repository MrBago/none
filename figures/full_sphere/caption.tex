\label{fig:fullSphere} A Sphere which is the mirror of the HemiSphere in figure \ref{fig:hemiSphere}. This Sphere has a total of 132 vertices. The green vertices of the original HemiSphere have been mirrored to create the blue vertices. Each of the green points is now a neighbor too, and shares an edge connection with, the mirror of the other green point.
