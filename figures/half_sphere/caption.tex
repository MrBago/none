\label{fig:hemiSphere} A HemiSphere with 66 vertices. The faces of this sphere are shown as a wire mesh. Two of these vertices have been highlighted in green. These two vertices are neighbors, even though they appear on opposite sides of the spherical surface, and therefore are connected by an edge. The edge that connects these two vertices is highlighted in red.
